## Insights and recommendations
* The Company's top selling package is the 24- 12oz bottle with sales of over $219k. This shows that 60% of the customer base prefer this product package over others i  recommend that The Company can carry out further customer survey on problems with the other product packages particularly 10 pkgs (least selling product package) in order to correct these issues. 
* The month of June recorded the lowest order quantity with 1,635.Also, there is a sharp decline of sales from $412,931 to $104,03k. The reasons for the decline in sales quantity sold and orders should be investigated and corrected. In addition, the company can provide time sensitive and opt in special offers to boost sales during this period.
* Jose Pavarotti is the company’s top customer so in order to solve this issue Jose Pavarotti should be rewarded  with discounts, freebies, upgrades, vouchers, or exclusive access to new products or services . This will further encour age other customers to do much more.
* Plutzer Lebensmittlgro is the company’s top supplier with over $401k in total sales should be rewarded. To further encourage our suppliers as well as boost sales, the company should create an incentive and referral bonus campaign to reward suppliers for achieving sales target as well as referring the company's products to prospective suppliers.

It Is Also Necessary To Conduct Market Analysis To Better Understand The Factors That Contribute To Sales Performances.

* The top three customers are taking more than half of revenue made by the company, which keeps the company at risks of generating revenue if any of them stop patronizing the company also The marketing teams should reinforce in getting new customers and also the bottom customers should be looked into so the generate more revenue in the coming future.
